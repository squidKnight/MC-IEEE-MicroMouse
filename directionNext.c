Purpose: identify the direction of the current node's backpath to prevent longer path to same node being taken.
Status: FINISHED, TESTED

/*short int directionNext(short int nodeCurrent[DATA], short int nodeNext)
INPUTS: int nodeCurrent[DATA]
	nodeCurrent: the node whose backpath is to be determined.
	nodeNext: the nodeID of the next node to take.
RETURNS: short int dire
	dire: new variable that gives the direction of nodeCurrent's backpath.
NOTES:
	Designed to prevent nodes with multiple direct connections to eachother from resulting in a longer distance than optimal being picked.
	Implemented to be called as:
		direction = changeDir(direction, directionBack(nodeList[nodeCurrent]));
		to update direction to new direction.
	0=up/straight, 1=right, 2=down/about face, 3=left
CAUTION:
	dire is initialized to -1, which is an invalid direction. If NODEID_P isn't equal to any of the directional NODEIDs or the correct path is impossibly longer than INFINITY, it will return the -1 and break later functions
