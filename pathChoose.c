RETURNS: short int dire, short int nodeList[NODES][DATA]
	dire: a new variable for the new direction, which is returned.
	nodeList: updates the explored directions directly.
NOTES:
	implemented to be called as:
		direction = pathChoose(nodeList, nodeCurrent, direction, position);
		to set direction to new orientation once it has returned.
	Doesn't check for direct loopbacks, they need to be checked externally before this function executes.
CAUTION:
	Manipulates the nodeList array passed to it directly.
