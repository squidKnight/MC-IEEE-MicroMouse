Purpose: check to see if the current location is a node
Status: FINISHED, TESTED

NOTE: ONLY COMPATABLE IN SIMULATOR!! Need to translate and incorperate finished movement/sensor functions once algorithm in stable
NOTE: most of the simulator-based functions start with "API_" so any that have this prefix need to be replaced for the physical bot
